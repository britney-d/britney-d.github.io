### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorites of the course as it was my first introdution
    into computer science in general. I learned how to navigate through GitHub,
    the terminal, and VS Code. It was an essential lab into the foundations of the
    class and to C++ basics.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 involved utilizing the concepts learned in Lab 1 and tying them into future
    uses in the class in an effective manner. It was one of my favorites due to how it
    was written in order to cater beginners. As someone entirely new to computer science,
    and not involved with the field it was a very important lab to reinforce skills. It
    was always a good look back when needing to jot back memory.

* Lab 7
    
    Lab 7 was also a favorite of mine due to the implementation of various concepts.
    For example, bool and if-statements were a large componenet to this lab and it
    would give a scope into how future labs would be set up. In addition, it allowed
    me to familiarize myself with working on multiple files.
